- this fine tool is built on top of excellent ‚ú®, but a bit dated libraries. Please downgrade your Firefox browser to a version between 53 and 59 to make this script work. You can find a [download for Firefox v59 here](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/59.0b9/)
- get a hold of the latest blog post url, e.g. `https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/11/16/the-ember-times-issue-73.html`
- finally run the script and pass in the url pointing to the latest blog post:
```
casperjs create-goodbits-template.js --botemail="$GOODBITS_USER_EMAIL" --botpassword="$GOODBITS_USER_PASSWORD" --engine="slimerjs" --botblogurl="https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/11/16/the-ember-times-issue-73.html"
```
- use the `--debug=true` for development and debugging üíõ
- review üëÄ and feel free to improve the template at [Goodbits](https://goodbits.io/c/7430/emails) - this tool isn't perfect, but tries its best to help with the mundane copy-pasta work ‚úçÔ∏è
